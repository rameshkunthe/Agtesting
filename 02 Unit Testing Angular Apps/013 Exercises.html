            <p>Look at the ZIP file I've attached to this lecture. I've carefully designed and ordered these exercises. So, take them in the same order and be sure to compare your solutions with mine. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your tests may not be exactly like mine and that's perfectly fine. As long as they are clean, clearly named, and test various aspects of a component, they are good. You can run the code coverage tool to see if you have fully covered your code with tests. </p>

<p>Refer to my code as an "alternative" way of writing the same tests, and not the best way. There is no such a thing as the "best" way. This is subjective from one developer to another. While writing tests, I'm constantly making compromises. So, don't get hung up if your tests are different from mine!</p>
